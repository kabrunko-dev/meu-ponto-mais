## Icons

The chosen icons set was "Material Symbols / Material Icons" [git](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons).

We can see all icons available [here](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons).

## Ideas

- Create component and service for global loading

> It would be the only loading service for this state in the application

- Make a simple cache for some requests

> For example, `session` endpoint which data don't change or get updated often
